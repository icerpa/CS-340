# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

When writing programs, I focus on making them maintainable, readable, and adaptable by emphasizing structured design, clear documentation, and modularity. In Project One, I built the CRUD Python module with encapsulation, keeping all database operations contained within the AnimalShelterCRUD class. This approach made the code more organized and reusable, so I could easily modify or expand it without affecting other parts of the system.

I also incorporated error handling with try-except blocks, ensuring that if something failed, the application wouldn’t break completely. Instead, it would gracefully manage errors, making troubleshooting much easier. Using parameterized queries helped me keep database interactions flexible, allowing me to filter animal records dynamically without having to rewrite the code each time the filtering logic changed.

Working this way made debugging a smoother process and helped ensure the module was scalable for future enhancements. The biggest advantage was reusability—this CRUD module isn’t limited to just this project. It could easily be integrated into other animal shelter databases, expanded to include automated updates, or even adapted for a mobile app where users could browse rescue dogs and view their details instantly.


# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

When approaching problems as a computer scientist, I focus on breaking complex challenges into structured solutions. For this project, the first step was understanding Grazioso Salvare’s need to efficiently filter rescue dogs, which meant choosing the right tools to build a system that could handle dynamic queries while remaining scalable. MongoDB was the best choice for the database because of its flexible schema, allowing me to store records without being locked into a rigid structure. Using Dash as the framework enabled me to create a responsive, real-time dashboard without needing additional front-end development.

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring data flowed seamlessly between the database and dashboard. I relied on iterative testing to refine the filtering system and troubleshoot any unexpected issues with data retrieval. Unlike previous assignments, which focused on smaller, isolated coding problems, this project required real-world integration—connecting external databases, structuring queries effectively, and ensuring smooth user interaction across multiple components.

Moving forward, I would apply these strategies when designing client-driven databases by focusing on user needs first, ensuring queries provide meaningful and efficient results. I would also implement optimized indexing to speed up retrieval times and establish automated testing pipelines to validate functionality before deployment. This experience reinforced the importance of thoughtful database design and structured problem-solving in real-world applications.


# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists design, optimize, and implement systems that solve complex problems efficiently, and their work has a direct impact on businesses and organizations. Through this project, I was able to apply these principles by building a dashboard and data filtering system that helped Grazioso Salvare streamline rescue dog identification and improve decision-making. By automating breed distribution visualization, staff can now quickly assess available dogs instead of manually sorting through records, saving valuable time and effort.

The interactive map component allows rescue teams to efficiently track animal locations, enhancing response efforts and ensuring that dogs are placed in the right environment for training. Ultimately, this project boosted operational efficiency, significantly reducing manual workload while providing structured insights that support life-saving missions. Seeing how computer science can be applied to real-world challenges, especially one with such a meaningful impact, really reinforced the importance of thoughtful system design and problem-solving in this field.
